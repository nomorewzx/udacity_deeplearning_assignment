Once I read the reddit thread [Why can't you guys commenting your fucking code?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/6l2esd/d_why_cant_you_guys_comment_your_fucking_code/), I am deeply touched and feel even more comfortable with refactoring the code of assignments. HAHAHAHAHAH, pretty funny.
